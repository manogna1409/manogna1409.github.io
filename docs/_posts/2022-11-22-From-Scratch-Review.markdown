_“From Scratch”_ streaming on Netflix is a realistic yet dramatic depiction of love between two people Amy and Lino who belong to two extremely opposite cultures. Amy being from American Texas family (“home to cows”, they say in the movie) and Lino being the romantic, gorgeous Italian chef.  As universe conspires, both fall in love with each other on the streets of Italy. Till this part, it gave me the warmth of a classic Christmas story hoping for a fairy tale ending just as we dream for it in real life.  

I always believed that real life tests the strongest of the strong love in the world which was proven by some of the classiest love stories in history. Amy and Lino are no different to these couples. Lino moving to LA going against his father, risking banishment to support Amy pursue her passion. This is so refreshing to see for me who come from a patriarchic society. It should be normalized that either of the couple can support the other irrespective of gender. Re-establishing life in new country where you are the minority is extremely difficult and director has shown it with honesty. This sheer loyalty to the characters which the director has maintained throughout the movie has made me come out my stereotyping of the series as a Christmas story. 

Just when you realize all parts of your life professional/personal is going well and you find that ultimate peace that you were yearning for, life throws you into a situation which turns your life upside down and you can feel every second of it. Representing this, is rest of the series where Lino and Amy have to fight an unseen enemy, Cancer. Now, I have no experience dealing with cancer but director shows in an artistic way where enemy doesn’t really affect just one person, it affects the entire family. Marriages are tested to their brink of their failure. Even though Lino was the one suffering from cancer, I could see and feel Amy’s pain throughout his treatment. Only the support system, courage and hope will get people out of these situations. Well, money too but that’s not the only one. Even the supporting actors which is Amy’s and Lino’s family members make you feel like you are part of their family and makes you start looking into your life to make sure if you have such people who support you in every step of it. 


Most intriguing thing for me in this series is the pace at which each episode goes by. Each episode skips by multiple years at a time but only when you complete the series will you understand the need for that and how the director picked the most beautiful moments of their lives in just 8 episodes. 

Well, I don’t want to reveal what happens at the end of their fight, but you will definitely experience a circle of life in limited episodes and understand how beautiful life can be lived savoring, enhancing relationships around you in spite of what life throws at you. I cried, laughed, felt happy along with Amy and Lino. I felt like I had a front row seat to their undying love. It’s a must watch for people who are looking to feel different emotions. You will for sure relate to some of the emotions shown depending what phase of life you are in.
